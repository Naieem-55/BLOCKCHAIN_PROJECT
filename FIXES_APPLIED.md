# Fixes Applied to the Blockchain Supply Chain Project

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Port Configuration Issue (EADDRINUSE: port 5000)
**Problem**: Backend was ignoring the PORT environment variable and defaulting to 5000
**Solution**: 
- Removed BOM character (﻿) from the beginning of .env file that was preventing proper parsing
- Backend now correctly runs on port 5001 as configured

### 2. MongoDB Deprecation Warnings
**Problem**: useNewUrlParser and useUnifiedTopology options are deprecated
**Solution**: Removed these deprecated options from database.js

### 3. Duplicate Index Warnings
**Problem**: Multiple models had duplicate index definitions
**Solutions Applied**:
- **User.js**: Removed duplicate index on `email` field (already unique)
- **Product.js**: Removed duplicate index on `batchNumber` field (already unique)
- **Sensor.js**: Removed duplicate index on `sensorId` field (already unique)

### 4. Express Rate Limit Trust Proxy Warning
**Problem**: X-Forwarded-For header warning when behind proxy
**Solution**: 
- Added `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` to server.js
- Added standardHeaders and legacyHeaders configuration to rate limiter

### 5. Redis Connection Error Spam
**Problem**: Redis connection errors were spamming the console
**Solution**: 
- Limited reconnection attempts to 3
- Added error logging flag to only log once
- Application continues without caching when Redis is unavailable

## Current Status

✅ **Backend**: Running successfully on http://localhost:5001
✅ **Frontend**: Running successfully on http://localhost:3000  
✅ **MongoDB**: Connected and working
✅ **API Proxy**: Frontend correctly proxies to backend on port 5001
✅ **Authentication**: Registration and login working correctly

## Notes
- Redis and Blockchain services show warnings but are optional
- Application runs successfully without these services
- One sensorId warning may still appear but doesn't affect functionality
