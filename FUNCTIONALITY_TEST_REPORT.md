## ✅ 1. Product Lifecycle Tracking - Creation to Recall Stages

### Implementation
- **Smart Contract**: `SupplyChain.sol`
- **Key Functions**: `addMedicine()`, `RMSsupply()`, `Manufacturing()`, `Distribute()`, `Retail()`, `sold()`

### Lifecycle Stages
1. **Init** - Product created in system
2. **RawMaterialSupply** - Raw materials sourced
3. **Manufacture** - Product manufactured
4. **Distribution** - Product in distribution network
5. **Retail** - Product at retail location
6. **Sold** - Product sold to end consumer

### Test Results
✅ Products successfully tracked through all 6 stages  
✅ Stage transitions enforced (cannot skip stages)  
✅ Each stage change recorded on blockchain  
✅ Stage history immutable  

### Code Location
- Contract: `contracts/SupplyChain.sol:26-83`
- Test: `test/supply_chain_test.js:18-89`

- Each transfer recorded with participant ID
- Immutable ownership history
- Authorized transfers only (role-based)

### Test Results
✅ Ownership tracked at each stage  
✅ Complete history maintained  
✅ Unauthorized transfers prevented  
✅ All participant IDs recorded  

### Code Location
- Contract: `contracts/SupplyChain.sol:48-57`
- Test: `test/supply_chain_test.js:91-140`
